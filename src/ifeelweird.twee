I Feel Weird

:: Start
<<timed .5s t8n>>Well, this is it.
<<next 2s>>You've just arrived to college. 
<<next 2s>>And now you're alone.
<<next 2s>>Four lightyears away from your [[family]].
<</timed>>

:: family
You've left your family on your home planet, Zilli√≥n,
to take advantage of international space travel and 
pursue your goal of going to college on Earth.

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
It was the most difficult decision you've made this far,
as your family means everything to you.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
    But now you must take advantage of this oppurtunity
    and learn how to [[be okay on your own|own]].

    <</linkreplace>>
<</linkreplace>>
:: own
So, here you are. After a long and exhausting
ride across the galaxies, you've finally made it 
to the University of North Carolina. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
Shaded by the green foliage above, you observe the stone paths covering the campus grounds and 
start to think about just how different life is here.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
     You've spent quite a bit of your time back home reseaching
    the human experience, learning their facial expressions, body
    movements, how they eat, what they talk about, and how they 
    act in social situations. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
        You start to feel the uneasy, as normal human behaviors
        do not come naturally to you. You are worried you won't 
        fit in or they won't understand you. The feeling of isolation
        is not a good one. 

            <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\Interrupting your thoughts before they consume your entire mind, 
            you decide it is time to get settled in and start figuring this whole
            //human// thing out.

:: apartment 
After about a 10 minute walk off campus, you arrive at the place you will call 
//home// for the next year. You look up at the 5 story building covered in red brick and white siding and notice people
sitting out on their balconies, laughing with friends or watering plants that hang from the ceiling. 
[[Go to the office and retrieve your apartment key|key]]

After about 30 minutes of filling out confusing paperwork and dissociating to the instructions the apartment manager gave you,
you finally get to the door of your new place. 
       
     <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You stand there for another minute, knowing that when you walk in you will have to 
        introduce yourself to your roomates. Panic sets in as you stand there, terrified you will mess up your introduction
        and come off as weird. 

        //What if they hate you?//
        //What if you say the wrong thing to them?//
        //What if they think you are not interested in getting to know them? //

:: introduction
You start to go over the lines in your head, hoping the converstation will go as planned. After one last run through, you
unlock the door and slowly walk in. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ The smell of vanilla and clean linen hangs in the air. You look around and take in the layout. 
Straight ahead is a small living room with a black leather couch and a cheap wooden coffee table decorated with fake plants and candles.
A TV is set up on the wall and posters of what seemed to be characters from films hung around it. 

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ 
    Looking over to your left, you scan the quaint kitchen in an attempt to understand more about your new roomates. The fridge is crowded with photos 
    of people smiling and laughing, takeout menus, and magnets in the shape of different earthly animals. One top of the fridge you note the very small
    cups accompanied by an assortment of glass bottles filled with both clear and darker liquids. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ 
        Suddenly, you hear a door creak followed by the sound of shoes sliding on the wood floors. Your palms begin to feel hot and your heart speeds up
        as you know that the dreaded introduction is coming. You snap your head to the direction of the noise, and see
        a person come around the corner.

                 She pulls her auburn hair behind her ears, exposing more of her freckeld face. 
                 Turning on her heels, she starts walking back down the hallway.

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>> Stepping through the white door on the left, ??? states that this will be your room.

:: Unpacking
    Pulling the straps of your backpack off your shoudlers, you throw it on the desk that came with the apartment. 
    You only brought enough stuff to fit in your school bag as it is quite difficult to move by spaceship. 
    
    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ Unzipping your bag, you begin pulling your belongings out to st them up in your new room.

            <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>After unpacking your things, you are reminded that classes start in just two days, and there are many things you need to get done. 
            you make a list of things in hope that it will help you keep your thoughts organized. 
             Your list reads:
             * [[Declare a major|Declare]]

You walk through the glass doors of the campus library and search for an empty computer.
While walking around, the sounds of the environment occupy your mind; 
the clicking of the mouse, the heavy roar of the AC, the ringing on the phones,
the noise of mumbled conversations around you. 

 <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You take a deep breath as you find an empty seat. 
    After about 5 minutes of complete confusion and frusturation you find the major declaration page. 
    
        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You decide to declare a major in:
            <<listbox "$major">>
