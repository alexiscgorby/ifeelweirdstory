!Chapter 1: 
!To Start a New Life

You've left your family on your home planet, Zilli√≥n,
to take advantage of international space travel and 
pursue your goal of going to college on Earth.

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
It was the most difficult decision you've made this far,
as your family means everything to you.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
    But now you must take advantage of this oppurtunity
    and learn how to [[be okay on your own|own]].

So, here you are. After a long and exhausting
ride across the galaxies, you've finally made it 
to the University of North Carolina. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
Shaded by the green foliage above, you observe the stone paths covering the campus grounds and 
start to think about just how different life is here.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
     You've spent quite a bit of your time back home reseaching
    the human experience, learning their facial expressions, body
    movements, how they eat, what they talk about, and how they 
    act in social situations. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
        You start to feel the uneasy, as normal human behaviors
        do not come naturally to you. You are worried you won't 
        fit in or they won't understand you. The feeling of isolation
        is not a good one. 

            <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\Interrupting your thoughts before they consume your entire mind, 
            you decide it is time to get settled in and start figuring this whole
            //human// thing out.

You walk through the glass doors of the campus library and search for an empty computer.
While walking around, the sounds of the environment occupy your mind; 
the clicking of the mouse, the heavy roar of the AC, the ringing on the phones,
the noise of mumbled conversations around you. 

 <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You take a deep breath as you find an empty seat. 
    After about 5 minutes of complete confusion and frusturation you find the major declaration page.

sitting out on their balconies, laughing with friends or watering plants that hang from the ceiling.

:: introduction
You start to go over the lines in your head, hoping the converstation will go as planned. After one last run through, you
unlock the door and slowly walk in. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ The smell of vanilla and clean linen hangs in the air. You look around and take in the layout. 
Straight ahead is a small living room with a black leather couch and a cheap wooden coffee table decorated with fake plants and candles.
A TV is set up on the wall and posters of what seemed to be characters from films hung around it. 

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ 
    Looking over to your left, you scan the quaint kitchen in an attempt to understand more about your new roomates. The fridge is crowded with photos 
    of people smiling and laughing, takeout menus, and magnets in the shape of different earthly animals. One top of the fridge you note the very small
    cups accompanied by an assortment of glass bottles filled with both clear and darker liquids. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ 
        Suddenly, you hear a door creak followed by the sound of shoes sliding on the wood floors. Your palms begin to feel hot and your heart speeds up
        as you know that the dreaded introduction is coming. You snap your head to the direction of the noise, and see
        a person come around the corner.

     <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>After unpacking your things, which consisted of a family photo, your laptop, your comfort stuffed animal, noise canceling headphones, a couple outfits, and electronic power chords and connectors, you are reminded that classes start in just two days, and there are many things you need to get done.

    school only a few days a week and had more time spent with their family than at the school. College on Zilli√≥n didn't really exist other than specific technical schools.

    Walking in to the building, you find a directory on the wall and look for class 3041. 
    You take the stairs to the third floor and find your class. glancing at your phone again you see the time is 9:00am. You made it just on time. Embarressment averted. 
        
         <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You walk in and debate on where to sit.

 Walking back home, you walk through the door to see Anastasia sitting at the table.
    
    <<linkreplace "Say Hi" t8n>>\ You exchange greetings. 
    "How are you doing today?" Anastasia inquires. 
      
        <<linkreplace "Im doing well.">>\ Remembering its socially respectful to ask that question back you force out a "How are you doing?"

                    <<linkreplace "\"I'm a $major major\"" t8n>>\ Forcing at another socailly acceptable response, you ask what she is studying.
                   
                         <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>> "I'm a Biology major." she responds. Giving her a small smile and nod, you tell her you've got to go work on you school work before walking to your [[room]].

:: room
You never really understood why people ask questions like that. You've always just figured that people will talk about what they want to without someone else initiating the topic. 
It just seemed more efficient to talk that way. On Zilli√≥n that's pretty much how it went. You just started talking about things umprompted. 
                           
 <<linkreplace "Continiue" t8n>>\ Also, the fact that if someone tells you a story, you are supposed to ask more questions about them rather than bring up a story about yourself to show them you relate and understand them. What's that about?
                           
     <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ That is something completely foreign to you. There are so many social customs that you have to remember here on earth to not be considered rude or uninteresed, it's exhausting. 
                               
          <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ And don't even get started on the fact that people on earth speak //so slow//. Most of the time, you've finished their sentence in your head and have already answered them, but cannot speak it until they've finished talking. 
                                
               <<linkreplace"Continue" t8n>> Most people on Zilli√≥n are like that, except you've found the men generally interrupt, but most of the women stay quiet and just explode into a million piece on the inside until they can speak. 

                <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ And seriously, people seem to pay attention to others so easily. are they all dying on the inside? For you, your brain dives off into a million other places while someone is talking. Looking into their eyes comfortably is pretty much impossible.
                                  
                      <<linkreplace"Coninue" t8n>> You find it much easier to pay attention if you are looking down. If theres even the slightest hint of background noise, you are done for. Someone typing on a keyboard behind you? The clock ticking? There's no way you are processing a word of that conversation. 
                                      
                          <<linkreplace "Continue"t8n>>\ Yet, here on Earth you are expected to pay attention, make eye contact, respond to conversation, and mask the exhausting feeling of discomfort, pushing down the bubble inside you that wants to scream and run away and go on and on about whatever topic you have become hyperfixated on at the time. 
                                        
                              <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You wonder, does everyone think like this? Does everyone constantly analyze the body movements of the people they are around and mimic their gestures to make it seem more natural?
                                 Does everyone get completely distracted and frustrated by every little noise around them that they are not in control of? Does everyone think //am I making to much eye contact right now? look away for a second. tilt your head to the side. okay nod so they know you are with them.//?
                                 Does everyone think about every single thing but also nothing at the same time because their brains cannot stay on one train of thought for more than 2 seconds. Does everyone make their bed every single night before they go to sleep because they cannot stand the thought or feeling of a single wrinkle touching your body?
                                            
                                     <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ Still, you sit down at your desk and pull out your laptop to look at your assignemts like you aren't slowly going insane [[inside]].

Its been a week since your classes started. So far, they've gone okay. It's now the weekend, Anastasia invited you out to dinner with her and Annabelle because she is coming back into town today. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\You said yes because you want to get to know them even though you are nervous. They said to be ready at 6pm. Before that, you must get some school work done before its due. 

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\You glance at the clock

You hop on your laptop and look at your coursework calender. Clicking on the assignment due first, you realize you have to read a long article for a discussion post. 
    
    <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ Well, thats not good. You have always been really bad at reading. The attention span just isn't there. Unless you are extremely interested in the plot, its almost useless to even try. 
       
         <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ You sigh, knowing that this article is going to exhaust you. This alone will take up all of your time today.

It's now been three hours since you said you will start in an hour. You've been obsessing over natural disaster videos and haven't stopped to even look at your assignemt. Though, the entire time you have been thinking //you really need to start your work.//

    <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Its 2pm. You log into your school's website and see what work you have to do. You see that the assignment due first requires you to read a long article. Immediatley no. 

        <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\You find the easiest assignment you have, even though its due a week from now. It's a 10 question quiz. You begin the quizz and finish it within 7 minutes. 

            <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Well, at least you did something. Looking at another assignment, you see your professor posted some videos for the class to watch. 

                <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Clicking on the link to one of the videos, you start to watch it, putting it in 1.75x speed so you have a chance of retaining the information better.

                        <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\You click on it and deicde you'll watch the video for school later. 

                            <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\After going down another rabbit hole that feels impossible and painful to pull yourself out of, you go to the bathroom.

Looking up at the clock, it reads 2pm. You look down at your computer, which has about 3 other tabs open. 

You have shifted from sitting at your desk to the floor to your bed and back to your desk. 

    <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ You scroll through the reading document to asses how much you've read and see how much you have to go. 

         <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ Just Great. You've just gotten to page 4. You gave up on reading a while ago and started looking into your newest interest, natural disasters on Earth. 

            <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\About 30 minutes ago you pulled yourself back together and began reading again. Or, at least tried to. 

                <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Honestly, it would be a miracle if you've retained any of the information so far. You've read the same 4 paragraphs over and over again, trying to grasp the information before your brain goes off into a million other litle thoughts. 

                    <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Okay, time to ditch this assignment, You'll try again when it gets closer to the due date. 

                     <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Looking at your other classes, you see an easy 10 question quiz that wont require much focus. Taking about 7 minutes to do it, you feel a small victory.

:: dinner           
After a few hours out, you arrive back home from a local sushi resturaunt with Annabelle and Anastasia.

<<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ Over dinner, the three of you talked and got to know echother a little better. It was still a quite discomforting feeling for you still. 

    <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ Again, you found it hard to ask genuine questions and relate to them. The seem to be very nice, you just don't feel a deep conncetion. 
    The feeling of belonging is missing. 

        <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\  After most interactions you think, //[[is there something wrong with me?|wrong]]

        <</linkreplace>>
     <</linkreplace>>
<</linkreplace>>

:: wrong

 Laying down in your bed, you get on your phone and start to go down a rabbit hole googling how you feel. 

     <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ After about an hour of pulling together research from medical websites and gathering experiences from other people, things start falling in to place. 

        <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ You begin to realize quite a lot of symptoms fall in line to what humans call neurodivergnecy. Specifically, the learning disability ADHD. 

             <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ Sittng back in your desk chair, you go in to deep thought about your life. Experiences click into place. 

                 <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ On Zilli√≥n, this would just be considered normal. The people of Zilli√≥n have built an entire world that accomodates the way its people function. 

                    <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ But on Earth, its considered a "disability". 

                         <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ You have noticed that in the short time you've been on earth, life is much more difficult to just exist normally in. 

                            <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ You download a document detailing common and uncommon ADHD symptoms found predominantley in women. 

                              <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\You've found out that the majority of women do not get diagnosed until their adulthood due to steortypes and the societal upbringing perpetuated onto men and women from birth. 

                                 <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ You go through the list of symptoms and start checking off the ones you deal with: 

                                     <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\Time blindness, unable to focus unless interested in a topic, abandoning hobbies the second you start them, hyperfocusing on one thing for hours on hours and unable to do anything else, missing important details, incredible sensory issues, to name a few.

                                        <<linkreplace"Continue"t8n>>\ Once you go through the entire list, you look back at it in full. Noticing almost all symtoms are something you struggle with, you finally ask yourself the question: //Wait, do I have ADHD???//
