:: StoryTitle
I Feel Weird

:: Start
<<timed .5s t8n>>Well, this is it.
<<next 2s t8n>>You've just arrived to college. 
<<next 2s t8n>>And now you're alone.
<<next 2s t8n>>Four lightyears away from your [[family]].
<</timed>>

:: family
You've left your family on your home planet, Zilli√≥n,
to take advantage of international space travel and 
pursue your goal of going to college on Earth.

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
It was the most difficult decision you've made this far,
as your family means everything to you.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
    But now you must take advantage of this oppurtunity
    and learn how to [[be okay on your own|own]].

:: own
So, here you are. After a long and exhausting
ride across the galaxies, you've finally made it 
to ??? University. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
You've spent quite a bit of your time back home reseaching
the human experiences, learning their facial expressions, body
movements, how they eat, what they talk about, and how they 
act in social situations. 

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
    While observing the stone paths before you which are shaded
    by the green foliage above on the campus grounds, 
    you start to think about just how different life is here. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
        You start to feel the uneasy, as normal human behaviors
        do not come naturally to you. You are worried you won't 
        fit in or they won't understand you. The feeling of isolation
        is not a good one. 

            <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\Interrupting your thoughts before they cosume your entire mind, 
            you decide it is time to get settled in and start figuring this whole
            //human// thing out. 

            [[Find your apartment|apartment]]
