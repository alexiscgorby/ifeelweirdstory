!Chapter 1: 
!To Start a New Life

You've left your family on your home planet, Zilli√≥n,
to take advantage of international space travel and 
pursue your goal of going to college on Earth.

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
It was the most difficult decision you've made this far,
as your family means everything to you.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
    But now you must take advantage of this oppurtunity
    and learn how to [[be okay on your own|own]].

:: own
So, here you are. After a long and exhausting
ride across the galaxies, you've finally made it 
to the University of North Carolina. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
Shaded by the green foliage above, you observe the stone paths covering the campus grounds and 
start to think about just how different life is here.

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
     You've spent quite a bit of your time back home reseaching
    the human experience, learning their facial expressions, body
    movements, how they eat, what they talk about, and how they 
    act in social situations. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\
        You start to feel the uneasy, as normal human behaviors
        do not come naturally to you. You are worried you won't 
        fit in or they won't understand you. The feeling of isolation
        is not a good one. 

            <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\Interrupting your thoughts before they consume your entire mind, 
            you decide it is time to get settled in and start figuring this whole
            //human// thing out.

After about a 10 minute walk off campus, you arrive at the place you will call

sitting out on their balconies, laughing with friends or watering plants that hang from the ceiling.

        introduce yourself to your roomates. Panic sets in as you stand there, terrified you will mess up your introduction

:: introduction
You start to go over the lines in your head, hoping the converstation will go as planned. After one last run through, you
unlock the door and slowly walk in. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ The smell of vanilla and clean linen hangs in the air. You look around and take in the layout. 
Straight ahead is a small living room with a black leather couch and a cheap wooden coffee table decorated with fake plants and candles.
A TV is set up on the wall and posters of what seemed to be characters from films hung around it. 

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ 
    Looking over to your left, you scan the quaint kitchen in an attempt to understand more about your new roomates. The fridge is crowded with photos 
    of people smiling and laughing, takeout menus, and magnets in the shape of different earthly animals. One top of the fridge you note the very small
    cups accompanied by an assortment of glass bottles filled with both clear and darker liquids. 

        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ 
        Suddenly, you hear a door creak followed by the sound of shoes sliding on the wood floors. Your palms begin to feel hot and your heart speeds up
        as you know that the dreaded introduction is coming. You snap your head to the direction of the noise, and see
        a person come around the corner.

:: Unpacking
    Pulling the straps of your backpack off your shoudlers, you throw it on the desk that came with the apartment. 
    You only brought enough stuff to fit in your school bag as it is quite difficult to move by spaceship. 
    
    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ Unzipping your bag, you begin pulling your belongings out to set them up in your new room.

            <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>After unpacking your things, you are reminded that classes start in just two days, and there are many things you need to get done.

After a few hours of shopping at the local Walmart and Target, you arrive back at your apartment with a new pillow and comforter set, as well as
some hygeine essentails. Anastasia left a note with her number on your bedroom door saying she will be at work until tonight and to text her if you need anything. 

<<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ You bought a few frozen meals from the store to last a few days until you go to buy groceries. Walking to the kitchen to 
put them in the freezer, you take a look at the takeuot menus you noticed earlier attached to the fridge door.

You follow the instructions on the back of the box and turn the oven on. After a few minutes of waiting, the oven beeps letting you know 
it's preheated. You put you frozen burrito on the shelf in the oven and set the timer for 30 minutes.

Grabbing the external connection booster device of of your desk, you connect it to your phone and press your mom's contact. 
Listening to the ringback tone, you take a seat at the kitchen table.
    
        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ A few seconds later, a familiar voice speaks from the other end. "$name, is this you?"

                 I will get used to it though. How are things going at home?"

                    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ "Things are okay. We all miss you. I wish we could've come to Earth with you" she replies, guilt laced in her voice. 

                        <<linkreplace "\"Its alright mom, I will figure everything out.\"" t8n>> "You have responsibilities and an entire life on Zilli√≥n. They need you there."

!Chapter 2: Wait, Is This Normal?


Feelings of anticipation course through you as you approach campus. It's the first day of classes and you have no idea what to expect. 

    <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ Education on Zilli√≥n was much more community based, and most young people learned from their parents or the family's around them. Children went to 
    school only a few days a week and had more time spent with their family than at the school. College on Zilli√≥n didn't really exist other than specific technical schools. 
      
        <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>>\ University is completely foreign to you. Already, you see more people on campus than you have ever seen in school back home.
        
             <<linkreplace "Continue" t8n>> Standing upon campus, you realize you have no idea where the $major building is. Checking the time, it reads 8:55am. You realize your first class starts in 5 minutes.
